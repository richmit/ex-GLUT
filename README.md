Everybody loves OpenGL, and OpenGL beginners love GLUT! In fact, many
seasoned programmers, especially scientific programmers, use GLUT all
the time as a primary toolkit for OpenGL. Some windowing toolkits,
like FLTK, support GLUT compatibility modes so GLUT skills can often
be transitioned to such environments. The example programs on this
page are intended to get GLUT beginners, and OpenGL beginners, a few
examples to chew on.

You can read a bit more about these examples on my [home page](https://www.mitchr.me/SS/exampleCode/glut.html).

Have fun!
